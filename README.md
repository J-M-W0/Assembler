# Project Description

Hi there, my name is **Junzhe Wang**.
This project is about a assembler I wrote for the CPU I've designed. 
[CPU](https://github.com/J-M-W0/CPU)
I'll simply name this project RASM (runty assembler), because this assembler is so small and tiny haha.

To run the program, after compilation, simply type on your prompt:

> rasm input [output]

Please be noticed that the input file name came first, and must be of ending ***.rasm***.
And the output name will be customized identical to what you've typed, 
and the output file is in binary format.
If no output name given, it will be *a.out*, 
and it will also generate a text file named *a.txt* which could be used for **Logisim** to test the CPU I've designed.
